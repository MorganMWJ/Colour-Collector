								<p>	The players job is to push points out of the arena and into the goals to gain a higher score.
									For every point that misses a goal the player will lose a life, when the player gets to zero lives its game over.
									When there are no points left in the arena a new level will start, at the start of every level an amount of points dependant on the current level will spawn.
									On some levels there is a chance for an extra life to spawn instead of a point that can be collected by the player
									or/and an obstacle to spawn that if collected will cause the player to lose a life, all spawn chances/rates are dependant on the current difficulty setting.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Easy: </strong> Easy difficulty increases the size of the goals making it easy to score. Extra lives have a 75% chance to spawn on every level and obstacles don't spawn at all.
									<br />After level 5 the points per level is equal to the currentLevel + currentLevel%2.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Medium: </strong> On medium difficulty extra lives have a 75% chance to spawn every 2 levels and obstacles spawn every 2 levels after level 5.
									<br />After level 5 the points per level is equal to the currentLevel + currentLevel%3.
								</p>
								<p>
									<strong>Hard: </strong> On hard difficulty extra lives have a 75% to spawn every 4 levels and obstacles spawn every level after level 2.
									<br />After level 5 the points per level is equal to the currentLevel + currentLevel%4.
								</p>
								<p>
									Difficulty can be changed at any time during game play(See controls below).
									The current difficulty along with the players lives, level, score and personal high score is displayed on the in-game display on the right of the canvas.
								</p>
								<p>
									A high score is saved for the player in each difficulty, this score will persist between user visits to the site.
									For the difficulty to be changed the game has to be restarted, with the exception of when on the start screen, this is to prevent cheating by moving a score from easy to hard mid-way through a game.
								</p>
								<p>
									To move the player object with the mouse the cursor has to hover over it, when doing this the cursor will be invisible.
									When the mouse comes out of the arena or the user uses the arrow keys for alternative control the cursor will return to be visible.
									At this point the user must hover over the player if he/she wishes to regain control of the player.
